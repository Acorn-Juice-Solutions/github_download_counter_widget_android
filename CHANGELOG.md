# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] – 2026-09-19

Portfolio-grade release. Full internal rewrite. No behavior changes visible to end users
who were happy with the pre-1.0 version, but every file changed. Users upgrading in place
must re-enter their GitHub Personal Access Token — pre-1.0 stored it in plain
preferences; those keys are purged automatically on first launch of 1.0.0.

### Added

- Layered architecture (`domain`, `data.remote`, `data.local`, `data.repo`, `ui.widget`,
  `ui.settings`, `worker`, `di`, `util`).
- `EncryptedSharedPreferences`-backed token storage (`SecureTokenStore`), with
  `androidx.security-crypto`.
- Automatic hourly refresh via `PeriodicWorkRequest` (`NetworkType.CONNECTED`,
  exponential backoff).
- `If-None-Match` / ETag conditional requests. `304 Not Modified` costs zero rate-limit
  budget.
- Typed `X-RateLimit-Remaining` / `X-RateLimit-Reset` handling. On a one-shot refresh
  the app schedules a delayed retry at `resetEpochSeconds`.
- Direct `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tags/{tag}` endpoint (resolves tags that
  paginate off `/releases`).
- Material 3 theme + Dynamic Colors on Android 12+.
- Spanish localization (`values-es/strings.xml`).
- `UnconfiguredEmpty` widget state guiding the user to Settings on fresh install.
- `SafeLogger` that redacts `Bearer` / `Authorization` / `token=` substrings before every
  `Log.*` call.
- Full CI pipeline: Spotless (ktlint 1.4) + Detekt + JUnit + Robolectric (89 tests). A
  Kover-based coverage gate is checked in but currently disabled because Kover 0.9 does
  not yet detect the AGP 9 debug variant; the plugin will be re-enabled when upstream
  ships AGP 9 support.
- Release workflow that signs `assembleRelease` with a keystore stored in GitHub secrets
  and publishes the APK to a GitHub Release.
- Dependabot config, PR template, bug / feature issue templates.

### Changed

- Package renamed `com.example.downloadwidget` → `com.acornjuice.downloadwidget`.
- Widget refresh moved out of `AppWidgetProvider` into `RefreshWorker` +
  `ReleaseRepository`.
- `RefreshWorker` no longer instantiates provider classes via reflection — dispatch is
  through the `WidgetKind` enum.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` hardened: `allowBackup="false"`, `usesCleartextTraffic="false"`,
  explicit `data_extraction_rules.xml`, `backup_rules.xml`, `network_security_config.xml`.
- Preferences screen writes the PAT through a `PreferenceDataStore` that routes to the
  encrypted store.

### Removed

- Hardcoded `Acorn-Juice-Solutions/accuvideo-releases` URL and `v1.7.5` tag defaults.
- Unused `androidx.glance:glance` dependency.
- Stray `app/src/main/resources/androidManifest.xml` file.
- Legacy `pref_github_token[_widgetId]` plaintext keys (auto-purged on first launch).

### Security

- PAT is stored in `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (AES-256-GCM values, AES-256-SIV keys).
- `SafeLogger` redacts credential patterns from every log line.
- Manifest disables cloud backup, device transfer, and cleartext traffic.
